What is unit testing?

Unit testing is a software development process that test the smallest testable parts of an application(called units). These units are individually and independently from the application. Unit testing can be done both manually and automatically. Unit testing is a component of test-driven development(TDD). TDD requires that the developers write failing unit tests first then write code to pass the unit tests.
						
Unit testing is only vital to the performance of the unit, which encourages developers to modify and revised code without concerns result. Once all the units in a program have been found working efficiently and bug-free, larger components of program can be evaluated by integrated testing.
						
The development team needs to learn unit testing. The great benefit to unit testing is that the earlier a problem is identified and the fewer compound errors occur. A compound error doesnâ€™t break anything at first, but eventually conflicts with some code and results in a problem.
